This project is Selenium API for scraping Facebook messages from any account, you just need to provide login and password and it will log in to the account and return number of unread messages and content of these messages. It's one of my better projects in terms of quality of code and the only reason I made this repository public is so you can see my programming skills. I'm not intending to give instructions on how to run this project, it's only here so you can review my code.

There are some visible credentials for test accounts in env.py but these accounts are fake or empty so it's fine.
